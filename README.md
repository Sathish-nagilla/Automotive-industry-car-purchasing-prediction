# Automotive-industry-car-purchasing-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the car purchase amount that customers are willing to spend, which can help the automotive industry in designing and pricing new car models.
The dataset includes customer details such as name, email, country, gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth.
Irrelevant features like name, email, and country are removed during preprocessing to improve prediction accuracy.
The target variable (y) is the car purchase amount, while the remaining features are treated as inputs (X).
A machine learning model is trained to learn the relationship between customer attributes and purchase behavior.
The results can be used by car manufacturers for market analysis, customer segmentation, and strategic product design.
